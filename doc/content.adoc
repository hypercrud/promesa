== Introduction

A promise library for Clojure and ClojureScript.

On the JVM paltform _promesa_ is built on top of *completable futures* (requires jdk8). On
JS engines it is built on top of the https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/[bluebird]
promise library.


=== Project Maturity

Since _promesa_ is a young project there may be some API breakage.


=== Install

Just include the following lines in your dependency vector on *_project.clj_*:

[source,clojure]
----
[funcool/promesa "1.8.1"]
----

This package requires JDK8 if you are using it on the JVM and all
environments that the *bluebird* library supports on JS engines.


== User guide

=== Introduction

A promise is an abstraction that represents the result of an asynchronous
operation that has the notion of error.

This is a list of all possible states for a promise:

- `resolved`: means that the promise contains a value.
- `rejected`: means that the promise contains an error.
- `pending`: means that the promise does not have value.

The promise can be considered *done* when it is resolved or rejected.


=== Creating a promise

There are several different ways to create a promise instance:

.Example creating already resolved promise instances from plain values.
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[promesa.core :as p])

;; Create a fulfilled promise
(p/promise 1)
;; => #<Promise [1]>
----

If a `promise` function receives a plain value, it returns a resolved promise with
the provided plain value. If it receives an instance of `Error`, it returns a
rejected promise.

Also, it accepts a factory callback that receives two callable parameters: `resolve`
and `reject`. So you can use one or other to resolve or reject the promise
respectively.

.Example creating promise instance using a factory.
[source, clojure]
----
(p/promise (fn [resolve reject]
             (resolve 1)))
----

An other way to create a promise is using the `do*` macro which works similar to the
factory callback with the exception that to resolve the promise instead of calling
the `resolve` callback we just need to return the value:

[source, clojure]
----
(p/do*
  (let [a (rand-int 10)
        b (rand-int 10)]
    (+ a b)))
----

`do*` blocks work similarly to clojure's `do` block, so you can put any
expression but only the last one will be returned and that expression can be a
plain value or an other promise.

If an exception is raised inside the `do*` block, it will return the rejected
promise instead of re-raising the exception on the stack.


[NOTE]
====
In both platforms the promise factory function is executed synchronously and
making it blocking or not blocking is the user's responsibility.
====


=== Promise Chaining

The most common way to apply a function to a promise (or in other words, to chain
its execution) is using the well known `map` function:

[source, clojure]
----
(def result (->> (p/promise 1)
                 (p/map inc)))

@result     ; only on the jvm
;; => 2
----

For people coming from the JS world, there is also the `then` function that works
in the same way as `map` but with the parameters inverted:

[source, clojure]
----
(def result (-> (p/promise 1)
                (p/then inc)))

@result     ; only on the jvm
;; => 2
----

If you want to apply multiple functions instead of using multiple `then` or
`map`s, you can use the `chain` function:

[source, clojure]
----
(def result (-> (p/promise 1)
                (p/chain inc inc inc))

@result     ; only on the jvm
;; => 4
----

There is also the `mapcat` function that removes one level of nesting when dealing 
with multiple promises. It is specially useful if the function that you want to
apply to also returns a promise instead of a value:

[source, clojure]
----
(def incp #(p/resolved (inc %)))

(def result (->> (p/promise 1)
                 (p/mapcat incp)))

@result     ; only on the jvm
;; => 2
----

*Important*: The `mapcat` function is only useful in the JVM platform. In JS engines, the `map`
function already flattens the result magically (because the underlying implementation
does that).


=== Async/Await Syntax

==== `alet` macro (async let)

The _promesa_ library comes with convenient syntax-sugar that allows you to create a
compositions that looks like synchronous code while using the clojure's familiar `let`
syntax:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[promesa.core :as p])

(defn sleep-promise
  [wait]
  (p/promise (fn [resolve reject]
               (p/schedule wait #(resolve wait)))))

(def result
  (p/alet [x (p/await (sleep-promise 42))
           y (p/await (sleep-promise 41))
           z 2]
    (+ x y z)))

@result     ; only on the jvm
;; => 85
----

The `alet` macro behaves identical to the `let` with the exception that it always
return a promise and allows you to mark async operations with the `await` 
placeholder making it looks like a synchronous operation.

If an error occurs at any step the entire composition will be short-circuited,
returning exceptionally resolved promise.


==== `async` macro (general purpose)

In contrast to the `alet` macro, the `async` macro is more general purpose
and enables the usage of `await` in any place (not only on the let
bindings). Let see an example:

[source, clojure]
----
(def p (async
         (dotimes [i 3]
           (p/await (p/delay 100))
           (println "i=" i))
         10))

@p
;; i=0
;; i=1
;; i=2
;; => 10
----

As expected, it returns a promise which will be resolved with result of the body
when completed.

If you are familiar with *core.async* `go` macro, `async` macro works
in the same way (in fact, it uses core.async machinery to archive
that).

[NOTE]
====
Because of some differences in the macro implementation in clj and cljs, the
clojure version of macro is available in `promesa.async` namespace and ClojureScript
version of macro in `promesa.async-cljs` namespace.

.Example importing `async` macro in Clojure
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[promesa.async :refer [async]])
----

.Example importing `async` macro in ClojureScript
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[promesa.async-cljs :refer-macros [async]])

WARNING: experimental


=== Error handling

One of the advantages of using promise abstraction is that it natively has a notion
of error, so you don't need reinvent it. If some of the computations of the composed
promise chain/pipeline raises an exception, that one is automatically propagated to
the last promise making the effect of short-circuiting.

Let see an example:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (p/promise (ex-info "error" nil))
    (p/catch (fn [error]
               (.log js/console error))))
----

The `catch` function adds a new handler to the promise chain that will be called
when any of the previous promises in the chain are rejected or an exception is
raised. The `catch` function also returns a promise that will be resolved or
rejected depending on that will happen inside the catch hanlder.

If you prefer `map` like parameters order, it there `err` function (and `error`
alias) that works in same way as `catch` but has the parameters like `map`:

[source, clojure]
----
(->> (p/promise (ex-info "error" nil))
     (p/error (fn [error]
                (.log js/console error))))
----

[NOTE]
====
On the JVM platform the reject value is mandatory to be an instance of `Throwable`
but in JS platform it can by any value.
====


=== Branching

For adding both success and error handlers to a promise at the same time you can use
the `branch` function:

[source, clojure]
----
(p/branch a-promise
          (fn [v]
            (println "Ok" v))
          (fn [err]
            (println err)))
----


=== Working with collections

In some circumstances you will want wait a completion of few promises at same time,
and _promesa_ also provides helpers for that.

Imagine that you have a collection of promises and you want to wait until all of
them are resolved. This can be done using the `all` combinator:

[source, clojure]
----
(let [p (p/all [(do-some-io)
                (do-some-other-io)])]
  (p/then p (fn [[result1 result2]]
              (do-something-with-results result1 result2))))
----

It there are also circumstances where you only want arbitrary select of the first
resolved promise. For this case, you can use the `any` combinator:

[source, clojure]
----
(let [p (p/any [(p/delay 100 1)
                (p/delay 200 2)
                (p/delay 120 3)])]
  (p/then p (fn [x]
              (.log js/console "The first one finished: " x))))
----


=== Delays and timeouts.

JavaScript due its nature, does not allow you to block or sleep. But with promises
you can emulate the functionality using `delay` like so:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (p/delay 1000 "foobar")
    (p/then (fn [v]
              (println "Received:" v))))

;; After 1 second it will print the message
;; to the console: "Received: foobar"
----

The promise library offers the ability to add a timeout to async operations thanks
to the `timeout` function:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (some-async-task)
    (p/timeout 200)
    (p/then #(println "Task finished" %))
    (p/catch #(println "Timeout" %)))
----

In case the async task is slow, in the example more that 200ms, the promise will be
rejected with timeout error and successfully captured with the `catch` handler.


=== Scheduling Tasks

Additionally to the promise abstraction, this library also comes with lightweight
abstraction for scheduling task to be executed at some time in future:

.Example using a `schedule` function.
[source, clojure]
----
(p/schedule 1000 (fn []
                   (println "hello world")))
----

This example shows you how you can schedule a function call to be executed 1 second
in the future. It works in the same way for both plaforms (clj and cljs).

The tasks can be cancelled using its return value:

[source, clojure]
----
(def task (p/schedule 1000 #(do-stuff)))

(p/cancel! task)
----

== FAQ

=== Why bluebird instead of es6 promise?

Because it is the state of the art and the most performant promise implementation.

Let see some home made benchmarks:

[source, text]
----
lib=promesa number=500
promesa: 25.144ms

lib=promesa-raw number=500
promesa-raw: 15.646ms

lib=es6 number=500
es6: 2426.458ms

lib=zousan number=500
zousan: 114.634ms

lib=goog number=500
goog: 239.821ms
----


The `promesa-raw` lib refers to the raw usage of *bluebird* library
and as you can observe, `promesa` has some overhead. But it is nothing
important if you compare it with the rest of libraries.
